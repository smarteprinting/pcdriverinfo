          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-7 text-slate-600">
            Most driver advice online falls into two camps: dense documentation written for engineers,
            or pushy "speed up your PC" pages trying to sell you something. We wanted a calm third option.
          </p>

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-7 text-slate-600">
            PC Driver Info explains what each kind of driver actually does, in plain English, and walks through
            the most common problems with patience instead of jargon. We don't host downloads, we don't run a
            help desk, and we don't take sponsorships from the companies we write about. That independence is
            the whole point — it's what lets us stay neutral and honest.

            We are not affiliated with any hardware maker, software publisher, or operating-system vendor.
            We don't sell software, offer paid repairs, or provide one-to-one technical support. When you need
            to change something on your own machine, the safest source is always the official documentation
            from your device maker — and we'll always point you there.

          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base leading-7 text-slate-600">
            Plain English, always. Friendly, never condescending. If a sentence here ever reads like it was
            written to impress rather than to help, we got it wrong — and we'd genuinely like to know.
