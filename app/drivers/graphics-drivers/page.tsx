    {
      question: "Why does my screen flicker after a driver update?",
      answer:
        "Screen flicker after an update usually means the new graphics driver is conflicting with leftover components from the previous installation, or the display refresh rate has changed. Perform a clean driver reinstall and verify that your monitor is running at its native refresh rate.",
    },
    {
      question: "My second monitor isn't detected — is that the driver?",
      answer:
        "Often, yes. The graphics driver is responsible for detecting, configuring, and arranging connected displays. Updating or reinstalling the graphics driver, checking the display cable, and confirming the correct input source on the monitor resolves most multi-monitor detection issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should I update my graphics driver even if nothing is wrong?",
      answer:
        "If your system is stable and you're not experiencing problems, there's no need to update immediately. Casual users can update every few months or when a specific fix is released. Gamers benefit most from staying current because new game releases often include day-one performance improvements and bug fixes in updated drivers.",

For laptops, your computer maker's site is often the better source, since their build is tuned for your exact panel and power settings.",
