            "Virtual device drivers create software abstractions of hardware devices that either don't physically exist or are shared among multiple software environments. They are essential for virtualization platforms, emulation layers, and software systems that need to present a hardware-like interface to other software without requiring actual physical hardware to be present.",
            "In hypervisor environments such as those used for virtual machines, virtual device drivers (often called VirtIO drivers in Linux-based systems) provide virtual machines with access to storage, network, and display resources managed by the hypervisor. These drivers communicate with a virtual device backend running in the privileged host OS or hypervisor kernel rather than with real hardware. The virtual driver translates the guest OS's hardware requests into hypervisor-level calls, which the host then services using real hardware."
