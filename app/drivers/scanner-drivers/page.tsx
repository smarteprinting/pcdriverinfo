      question: "Scanning works over USB but not over Wi-Fi. Why?",

    "It's the classic multifunction complaint: printing is flawless, yet every scanning app insists no scanner exists. Nine times out of ten, the machine was set up with a basic or print-only driver, and the scanning half of the software simply was never installed.",

  description2:
    "The second classic is network scanning: printing travels one way, but scans travel back from the device to your computer — and a firewall can silently block that return path. Installing the maker’s full package and allowing its scan utility through the firewall resolves the overwhelming majority of cases.",

        "A scanner driver implements the standard scanning interfaces that imaging applications rely on. When any app asks for “a 300 dpi colour scan of this area”, the driver translates that request into hardware commands, runs the sensor across the page, and streams the image data back to whichever program asked.",
        "On multifunction printer-scanner devices there's an important wrinkle: the scanning driver is a separate piece of software from the printing driver. They ship together in the maker's full package — but a print-only installation quietly leaves scanning out, which explains one of the most common support mysteries."
