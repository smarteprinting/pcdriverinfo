      "User-mode drivers operate in a protected area of the operating system known as user space rather than inside the kernel itself. They communicate with hardware through operating-system services while remaining isolated from critical system components. This design significantly improves stability because faults are contained within the driver process.",

      "Many modern devices do not require unrestricted hardware access. Scanners, webcams, portable media devices, and numerous USB peripherals can function perfectly well using user-mode drivers. By keeping these drivers outside the kernel, operating systems reduce the likelihood of blue screens and other system-wide failures while maintaining excellent compatibility and performance."
