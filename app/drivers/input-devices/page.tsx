Keyboards, mice, touchpads, trackballs, graphics tablets, game controllers, and touchscreens all require drivers that translate their physical signals into standardized events that the OS and applications can consume.",
            "Many input devices use the USB Human Interface Device (HID) class protocol, a standardized USB specification that defines how keyboards, mice, and similar devices report their state to the host system. The HID protocol describes device capabilities through report descriptors — structured binary documents that explain the format of data packets the device will send. A keyboard's report descriptor specifies which bits represent which keys, and the HID class driver parses incoming reports using this descriptor to generate key press and release events."
