    'A printer that shows “offline” while sitting right there, a queue that won’t move, pages of gibberish symbols, or blank sheets — these are the printing classics, and nearly all of them live in software, not in the machine.',

  description2:
    '“Offline” simply means the computer can’t reach the printer at that moment — a Wi-Fi hiccup, a sleeping device, or a stuck job blocking the queue. Gibberish output usually means the job was rendered with the wrong driver, often a near-match model. The reliable fix is to clear the queue, then reinstall the full driver package for your exact model from the manufacturer’s support page.',

                "Offline means the computer can't reach the printer right now. Make sure the printer and computer are connected to the same network, restart the printer, clear any stuck jobs from the print queue, and verify it's selected as the default printer. In stubborn cases, rerun the manufacturer's setup utility to rediscover the device.",
