            "Kernel-mode drivers operate within the most privileged layer of an operating system — the kernel itself. They execute in kernel space, which means they have direct, unmediated access to every system resource, including physical memory, hardware registers, and I/O ports. This high level of privilege is essential because these drivers need to respond to hardware events with minimal latency and maximum control.",
            "Because kernel-mode drivers share the same memory address space as the operating system kernel, any serious problem in a kernel-mode driver can destabilize the wider system. On Windows, this typically results in a stop error. For this reason, kernel-mode drivers are implemented with extreme care, following strict coding standards, memory management rules, and synchronization primitives provided by the operating system's kernel development frameworks."
