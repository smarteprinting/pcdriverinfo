      question: "My headphones are paired, but sound still comes from the laptop. Why?",
      answer:
        "Pairing and audio routing are separate processes. Even after a successful Bluetooth connection, your computer may continue using its built-in speakers as the default output device. Open your sound settings and manually select the headphones as the active playback device.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my Bluetooth mouse stutter near my Wi-Fi router?",
      answer:
        "Bluetooth and many Wi-Fi networks operate on the crowded 2.4 GHz frequency band. USB 3 devices can also create interference in the same range. Moving the mouse, receiver, or computer farther from the router and other sources of interference often improves performance. In most cases, signal congestion is the cause rather than the Bluetooth driver itself.",
    },
    {
      question: "My headphones pair with my phone but not my computer. What's different?",
      answer:
        "Computers often keep outdated pairing records that can interfere with new connections. Remove any existing entry for the headphones from your Bluetooth settings, place the headphones back into pairing mode, and try again. Installing the latest Bluetooth driver from your laptop or motherboard manufacturer can also resolve compatibility issues.",

    "A device that refuses to pair, headphones that connect but play no sound, or a mouse that dies every time the laptop sleeps — Bluetooth's classics are consistent, and so are the fixes.",

  description2:
    "Stale pairing records cause most refusals: removing the device from the list and pairing fresh clears them. Audio-but-silent is usually a default-output selection, not the radio. The post-sleep vanishing act is typically caused by power management putting the radio into a sleep state it doesn't recover from — adjusting that setting plus installing the latest driver from your laptop maker usually fixes it.",

      "The Bluetooth driver operates your computer's 2.4 GHz short-range radio — but the radio is only the start. Above it sits a software stack that runs discovery (“what's nearby?”), pairing (“do we trust each other?”), and the long-term list of devices your machine remembers.",
      "Every kind of gadget then speaks its own profile — one for stereo audio, one for keyboards and mice, one for file transfer — and the stack loads the right profile for each connection. That's why one radio can serve your headphones, your mouse, and your phone at once, each in its own dialect, while the driver also manages the radio's power draw so your battery survives."
