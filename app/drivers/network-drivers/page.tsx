      question: "Why is my Wi-Fi slower on my laptop than my phone?",
      answer:
        "This is often caused by the laptop's wireless adapter running in an aggressive power-saving mode or using an outdated driver. Updating the Wi-Fi driver and disabling unnecessary power-management settings for the network adapter can significantly improve performance and bring speeds closer to what you see on other devices.",
    },
    {
      question: "My Wi-Fi disconnects when the laptop sleeps. Is that normal?",
      answer:
        "It's a common issue, but it can usually be fixed. During sleep, the operating system powers down the wireless adapter to save battery life, and some drivers don't restore the connection properly when the device wakes up. Installing the latest driver and disabling 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' often resolves the problem.",
    },
    {
      question: "Ethernet works but Wi-Fi doesn't — what does that tell me?",
      answer:
        "Because Ethernet and Wi-Fi use different hardware and drivers, a working Ethernet connection usually means your internet service and operating system are functioning correctly. The issue is more likely related to the wireless adapter's driver, settings, or hardware rather than the network itself.",
