            "Storage drivers manage communication between the operating system and data storage devices, including hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), NVMe devices, optical drives, and network-attached storage controllers. These drivers are responsible for translating file system read and write requests into the specific command sets understood by the storage hardware.",
            "For traditional storage devices, drivers implement the Advanced Host Controller Interface protocol, which defines how software communicates with storage controllers. Non-Volatile Memory Express devices use a newer, purpose-built protocol designed for the low-latency, high-parallelism nature of flash storage. These drivers support thousands of simultaneous input and output queues, compared to the single queue model of legacy disk interfaces, allowing modern solid-state drives to approach their theoretical maximum performance."
